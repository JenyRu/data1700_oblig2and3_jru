Short description of application:

A JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, Java, and SpringBoot application that registers movie ticket orders.
I added three imaginary movie alternatives and five input boxes for 
ticket amount, first name, last name, phone number, and email. 
The "Buy Ticket"-button can only be clicked if the form input is validated. 
When the form is submitted successfully the input is sent as objects 
to an array and displayed under "Current Tickets". This will simultaneously 
reset the input fields. Buttons for editing and deleting individual tickets 
were added next that updates, or deletes the ticket, both on the page and in the database.
Bootstrap styling was also applied.
